= What is FaceDroid =

FaceDroid is an idea to build an Android app Community driven that brings the features of the Facebook platform to Android devices as well as enhance it with specific OS and hardware features available on the devices. The availability of the Facebook API and the rich Android API are a great source for the community to build this app.

= How does it work? =

To develop Facedroid, I had to use a Server proxy to allow users to login to Facebook.  I had to use a server since the Facebook Platform calls back the server when using Facebook connect as the login method. 

Other architectural decisions were: 
 * FBML can not be directly used. It offers social content but it only works for application rendered within the Facebook platform.
 * Facebook API: only provides a small subset of features and no real social content, so it didn’t make sense to use it, yet.
 * If a proxy server is used, we shouldn’t cache any personal/social content 
 * Facebook connect provides a JavaScript API that includes almost all Facebook API calls and a way to invoke FBML code in the Facebook platform and get the social content.  So, I can say that Facedroid app is:
 # a proxy server that ease the Facebook Connect process and send a set of HTML pages to the Android App. *No application server is required*, *no real content is retrieved or cached here*.
 # an Android application, that uses a WebView widget to render the pages retrieved from the proxy server. These pages includes Facebook Connect JavaScript that calls and get the content directly from the Facebook Platform using AJAX technology. The WebView widget also allows to bind a Java Object to a JavaScript Object: that’s could be the door to integrate all devices features, hardware resources and Android applications into the Facedroid app. We can include that special JavaScript in the HTML pages being served by the proxy server, and they will only work on an Android device.   Facebook Connect JavaScript is in Beta phase.

==The main technical issues could be:==

 * Facebook log in: Facebook connect is oriented to a web site to integrate into Facebook. In fact, we need a web server and create some files there to allow FB Connect. 
 * The full/fun social features are provided using FBML which is a set of tags that can be embedded in an HTML page, and the content is rendered when it is generated by the web server. There's a way to generate FBML content in the Facebook server and get the results back ( fb:serverfbml ), but it doesn't really work for me yet.

==What is implemented==

 * Currently, Facedroid could be considered as a really early prototype, just the starting point of what can be done. 
 * A basic Dialog to log in using Facebook Connect
 * A home tab to provide access to wall info and updates (not real content is retrieved now)
 * A Profile tab including user picture and status
 * A Friends tab, that list all user friends from facebook with their current status line
 * An inbox tab, that displays the number of unread items.

=Requirements=
 * A Facebook application ID
 * Android emulator + SDK
 * Web Server
